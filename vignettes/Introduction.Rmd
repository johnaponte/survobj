## Introduction

This document explores how the package `survobj` should organize the classes required for easy understanding and use.

The objective is to create an object that can be used in graphs and simulation of survival times but give the flexibility of using the same API to change the survival distribution type.

So the object should be produced from a factory

```{r eval= FALSE}
s_factory(s_family, parameters)

s_factory(s_exponential, list(attack_rate = 0.4, time = 1))
```
