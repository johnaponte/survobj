Total refractory of the factories and functions.

- function rsurvdf is defunct and replace by rsurvhr which is easier to use

- lincomb function is not needed anymore and deleted

- Inclusion of functions for censoring

- Inclusion of graphs for comparison

- Removal dependency on plyr

- Inclusion of tests


# survobj 0.2
